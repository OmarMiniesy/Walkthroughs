Downloading the image and then running the `hexeditor` tool on the image:

```bash
hexeditor garden.jpg
```

We are met with hex on the left and text on the right, clicking on `CTRL+E` shows us the text view, and then using `CTRL+W` to search for `pico`, we see the flag:

```
picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}
```
